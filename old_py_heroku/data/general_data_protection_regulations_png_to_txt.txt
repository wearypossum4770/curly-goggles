concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be
aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. * This includes the right for data subjects
to have access to data concerning their health, for example the data in their medical records
containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating
physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. * Every data subject should therefore
have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for
which the personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data
are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal
data processing and, at least when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing.
